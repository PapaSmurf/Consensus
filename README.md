Concensus
=========

A balanced site to bring us together

This Drupal site was created at the June 2012 Atlanta RHoK as a transparency initiative 
to bring together both sides of the issue so that citizens can read and discuss the issues of the day
and representatives can see how voters in their district feel about an issue.

We hope this site ends the segregation of news by ideology, and restores faith in our representative democracy.
